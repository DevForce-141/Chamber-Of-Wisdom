# Chamber-Of-Wisdom
A repository that contains words/articles of wisdom, otherwise learned/acquired after sufferings!

## Contributing
We use github markdown and store all the content in markdown files.
Please contribute via Commits (if you are a member) or Pull requests.
Here is an [example file](/example.md#article-title) to get you started.

### Articles TODO List
- Running Laravel Scheduler in Windows Server 
- Browser Storage, Cookies, Local Storage, Session Storage & Indexed DB. When to use one or more of these. 
- Revisit the timezone thing and write an honest wisdom about it.
- Why Mobile first design? Because it is easier to scale up than scale down. After a certain size, you content presentation won't change. Example: you section would be 80% width at 1000px width and even at 4000px.
