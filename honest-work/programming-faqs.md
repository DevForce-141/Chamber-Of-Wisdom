## What is Web Design?
Web Design refers to the design part of the web. The design itself contains a Creative part
where you conceptualize what needs to be built. As humans, we need visualizations for so many reasons (good), so we
create mockup/wireframe/prototype which help us understand what design could be. It could be highly detailed (all the design)
with interactivity (actions that happen upon hovering, clicking elements) or it could be just a detailed image of the design.
Sometimes it's a simple mockup/sketch which just indicates the sections of the design and placement of elements (for example,
the position of the big button, position of header, hero image, sidebar etc.). There's no rule/guideline carved in stone,
just do what can get the job done and smoothly!
Once you've a design to build, it needs to be built for the web using front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
As a front-end developer, you're responsible for the HTML, CSS, JS part. However, in reality, you might be expected to
build the design mockup/prototype as well. In Some scenarios, you might have to do the creative work as well where you
conceptualize and visualize the design as well.

### What's Frontend Development?
Frontend development involved using the HTML, CSS, JS to build up the webpages. It's called frontend because it defines
the front/look and feel of the website. From a real world example, The dining hall, reception of a restaurant is frontend
whereas the Kitchen is the backend.

### What's Backend Development?
Backend development refers to the server side of the web. It involves working with server, database, application logic,
APIs etc. Backend is responsible for the behind the scenes work that makes the frontend work. For example, when you click
on "Checkout" Button, it's  the backend which creates your order, determines the price, send it over to the Payment Processor
and shows you a page where you provide your payment details to pay and complete the order.
When someone suspiciously tries to login to your account, it's the backend which detects it and send you notification
(email/in-app).

### What's Application or Business Logic?
Application or Business Logic refers to the logic that defines how your application works. Technically, it's the functional
logic of any application which does a specific task. These days, Business logic refers specifically to the logic which
is responsible for the features of your application. Even though Login, Signup, Password Reset are also features, they are
not often considered part of business logic because they are common to almost all applications and often they are built
on shared ground (many frameworks/ecosystems provide these out of the box).

## What's difference between Web development and Web Design?
Both of these terms don't have any standard and are used/thrown around without clear distinction. However, we'll try to
answer it semantically. Web Design refers to the design part of the web. The design itself contains a Creative part
where you conceptualize what needs to be built. As humans, we need visualizations for so many reasons (good), so we
create mockup/wireframe/prototype which help us understand what design could be. It could be highly detailed (all the design)
with interactivity (actions that happen upon hovering, clicking elements) or it could be just a detailed image of the design.

Web development is often used to wrap up everything (basically fullstack web development) or sometimes it's used  in context
where it refers to the backend part only.
