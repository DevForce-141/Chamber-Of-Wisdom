Elementor Loop grid allows you to display your posts (custom post types as well) via a loop template. However, it's often a requirement that you need to filter the posts.
There's a taxonomy filter but there's nothing in elementor if you want to perform a text search. There are 3rd party plugins but it doesn't feel good to pay $69 for a plugin for one damn thing!

Luckily, some chad has created a free plugin which works very well and even supports AJAX based filtering. The plugin is called 
[Better Post & Filter Widgets for Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-post-filter-widgets-for-elementor/#the%20post%20meta%20are%20not%20displaying).
The [demo](https://wpsmartwidgets.com/doc/better-post-and-filter-widgets/filter-post-widgets-demo) of that plugin looks promising and covers so many different types of filters that you'll come across!
