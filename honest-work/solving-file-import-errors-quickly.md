### Introduction
Have you banged your head for hours for errors like Class/File not found while it seems that you're importing it correctly.
There could be many things wrong with the import but the gist is that your import reference is incorrect. It could be casing
difference, slightly off path, backslash/forward slash thing.
But there's one tool to solve them all!
Use a text diff tool. It got everything to make your temporary biased and blind eyes see the truth.
Just copy the import path/string from your code and copy the mentioned path in the error message. Make sure you copy to NOT
leave any room for human error again!
