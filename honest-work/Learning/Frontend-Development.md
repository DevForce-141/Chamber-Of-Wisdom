# Get Started
This is a personal recommendation to get started with frontend development.
At present, it is focused on backend developers who are terrified of the design!

A brief is added first, the resources are added at the end.

## Tips
1. Anytime you see a layout, break it down into sections.
2. For each section, break it down into rows and columns. Mostly, you'll be using Grid/Flexbox for your layouts.
   They seem similar, but they are slightly different and cater to specific use case.
3. Once in row and column level, build up each element.
4. With the above and knowing some CSS, you can build up the skeleton and signs of life in design (transitions & animations)
   by knowing some CSS. However, there's a big part of ``How to make it look good?``.

## How to make it look Good?
If you're starting off, you might be suffering from a phenomenon where you aren't satisfied unless you add 10-20 colors
in your design; But once you are finished with adding so many colors, it'll look like some RGB party and soon enough,
it will feel like a mess.
My recommendation is to follow some rules, and stick to them; After some time, your brain will be recalibrated to appreciate
the new way!

Following points differentiate between an appealing, goal oriented, themed design and an RGB party.

### 1. Typography
It can change the appearance and perception of design. Your typography involves font families, font sizes, font weights,
text decorations, text colors, Line heights, Letter spacings.
Change in these properties, change the density/volume of the content. If you use bigger font sizes, you'll occupy more
space on page. Similarly, certain fonts maybe be already bold enough that adding bold font weight to them will look like
obesity in your text.

If you're building in reference to some design, please get the typography right as the very first thing. Otherwise, you'll
feel your design is not like the reference!

### 2. Colors
Choose Colors carefully. There are certain colors that you can't avoid and they shouldn't be considered part of your
color set. Those colors are:

#### Neutral Colors
Black, White, Gray are the neutral colors. They are most used across the design. You may choose a certain variation of them
instead of pure black, white or gray.

#### Contextual Colors
Contextual colors are used to convey contextual information like Error, Warning, Info, Subtle Notice etc. If you're
following any CSS library/framework, you'll have them.

Mostly these are:
Red, Green, Orange/Yellow, Gray, Blue, Purple etc.

#### Choosing Colors
Since we've discussed Neutral & Contextual Colors, it's time to pick the colors for your design. You need few colors like
1-4 colors. Depending on how complex your design is, you might need 4 colors; Mostly, 1-2 colors are good and derived
from logo AND/OR Brand guidelines.

You can conceptualize them as ``Primary, Secondary``. Once you've these two, you can lean toward "accent colors" which are
variations of Primary & Secondary Colors respectively. However, these colors fit in well in alternations and provide good
contrast. i.e. If you're using Primary as background, you can safely use accent color for primary as foregorund/text color.

Furthermore, some designs are more branded where the brand colors are used a lot. It happens when most of content is presented
with brand colors instead of neutral colors. This is not a wrong approach/way but it's just that the primary color will
be less visible in your design as opposed to what the name "primary" implies.

#### 3. Spacing
Spacing is the breathing room of a design. No matter how good the other components of your design are, if the spacing is
inconsistent and not adequate, the design will NOT look good.
Keep in mind that spacing is a generic term for Paddings, Margins, Gaps.

Some tips for picking up spacings are:
1. Be consistent. Really!
2. Define your elements and pick a spacing size for them and re-use it. For example, Sections should be spaced by
   2.5rem; Cards need to have 1rem spacing, Spacing between lines of text need to be 0.5rem etc. Consistency is the key!

## FreeCodeCamp Certifications
The certification includes learning content as well but personally, I found it useful for practice and knowledge test.
It's upto you whether you want to learn from here or first learn and use it for practice and knowledge test.

## MDN
MDN has it's learning material and it seems good but I haven't tried it. Although most people use it as reference
for docs regarding HTML, CSS, JS.

## W3Schools
W3Schools is a beginner friendly resource and their content presentation is lightweight and clutter free. For this reason,
beginners tend to prefer it but keep in mind that it is NOT always comprehensive and might mislead sometimes. Be prepared
to unlearn some of the things at a later points.

## Closing Note
The tips and instructions are a results of experience and heavily inspired by 
[Refactoring UI Book](https://refactoringui.com/).
This book de-mystifies the visual appeal of design into structured and reasonable process!

I highly recommend to read this book!
