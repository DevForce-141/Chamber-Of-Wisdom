# Pre-requisites
1. A decent computer (desktop/laptop). 
   1. 2 core CPU & 8GB RAM is bare minimum. 4 or 6 core CPU and 16GB RAM is recommended. 
   2. An SSD is highly recommended over HDD. SSD will keep your apps running smooth and load fast, it can even compensate
      for lack of RAM via Page memory feature.
2. A decent internet connection. You don't need a blazing fast connection but a stable connection is important. 
   1. An 8Mbps (around 1MB/s) is starting point. Having a 20Mbps (around 2.5MB/s) connection is recommended.
3. Your work environment is totally upto you but having a reasonable comfy environment will keep you productive, happy

   cook up in maybe 1-2hrs.
4. Decent English Skills. 
   1. At the very least, your reading needs to be good so you can read docs, blog posts, forums. 
   2. Having decent listening skill will allow you to benefit/learn from courses available in English.

# Getting Started with Programming
Programming is very vast field. Broadly speaking, Web, Mobile (Android, iOS), Desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux), 
Game Development, Data Science, Machine Learning/AI, Embedded Systems (IoT) are some of the broad fields. You need to assess
what feels interesting to you.

Each of these subfields/domains/specializations have their own pros, cons, challenges and perks. If you can stay consistent,
you'll eventually find your spot, so go after what you love!
Unless you can't make the ends meet, you'll appreciate doing what you love over the money. Remember, that excellence
and expertise is rewarded; If you can become the expert and do with excellence, you'll find good money making 
opportunities down the road.

Moreover, once you're into programming, gain experience, moving into another platform/ecosystem/language will be easier
for you relative to when you were starting fresh!
Let's discuss some pros and cons first.

## Pros
1. High Paying Jobs
2. A unique work environment which is off the traditional jobs/working hours. 
3. Remote Work Opportunities 
4. Freelancing Opportunities 
5. Regardless of where you're, you've the potential to compete in an international pole, find your place, get good compensation
   and enjoy your life 
6. If you're the founder kind of person, hopefully you'll end up with something of your own which pays well.

## Cons
1. Difficult for beginners. These days, there's so much tooling which is overwhelming for the beginners.
2. Requires a lot of time investment as beginner. You've to grow a lot in your initial 1-3 yrs. If you can grow in 1-5 yrs,
   the path down feels much less daunting.
3. Somewhere, somehow, someday, Impostor Syndrome will attack you and if you're not mentally strong before it happens,
   you will probably have a rough phase of your life in terms of mental health.
4. The interviews and hiring process is crazy. I would say that it's very time-consuming, exhausting and kind of stupid
   as well because you're asked to do things and questions which are poles apart from your day-to-day work.
5. Your company and it's culture can affect your life. If your infra is on shaky grounds, you might have to wake up at 2am.
   At times, you'll overwork.
6. With all the cons combined, there's risk of burnout. If you don't take care of yourself, you might end up in a bad place
   mentally and physically.
7. You need to be self-motivated, disciplined and accountable. If you can't manage yourself, you'll find it difficult
   to grow and sustain in this field.

*The pros and cons are mentioned here, not to gate-keep or discourage you but in good faith under the belief that important
and critical information should be presented to you so you can make an informed decision. So many people are in this field,
and had a different journey; It's not an impossible or difficult field if you've the love for it, you'll make it and enjoy
it. If you're solely here for the money, you should reconsider whether you can navigate through it all; Because,
"When life leaves us blind, love keeps us kind"*

Since the author is primarily a Web Developer, the resources mentioned here are primarily for Web Development.

# Intro to Web Development
Web development is related to almost everything that is on the internet. Anything that's on the internet, contains at least
some part which is covered under web development.
There are three main parts of web development:
1. Frontend Development
2. Backend Development
3. Databases/Persistent Storage

If you have some technical questions, here's a [Post](https://github.com/DevForce-141/Chamber-Of-Wisdom/blob/main/honest-work/programming-faqs.md) 
which covers common and yet confusing (for beginners) questions that we've attempted to answer in simple ways and 
clear up the confusion.

## Frontend Development
This is everything users see and interact with directly in their browserâ€”buttons, layouts, colors, animations, forms, etc.
It focuses on technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, often combined with frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular.

## Backend Development
This is the behind-the-scenes logic that powers the application. It handles things like user authentication, data processing, security, and communication between the frontend and the database.
Common backend languages and frameworks include PHP (Laravel), Python (Django/Flask), JavaScript (Node.js/Express), and Ruby (Rails).

## Databases / Persistent Storage
This is where information is stored and retrieved. For example, when you log into a website, your credentials and profile details are fetched from a database.
Databases come in two main types:
Relational (SQL), like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB.
Non-Relational (NoSQL), like MongoDB or Redis.

## Learning Resources
### [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
Their content presentation is simple, has walkthrough nature and easy to read. However, their content is not very in depth
and might be inaccurate a few of the times. Their reference are pretty good for lookups!
As a beginner, this is a pretty good point.

### [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
They offer learning material in their certification courses. The best part is they solve the ``project problem`` for the
beginners who are wondering what to build after they've learned some stuff. They contain enough to make you feel more
confident and give you experience

### [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/)
A free and paid resource. Some courses are free while others are paid.  If you're in Laravel Ecosystem, it's a great resource
which touches on so many topics for beginner, intermediate, expert levels. It's worth checking out!

### [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)
MDN is the best and comprehensive resource. However, it might be very overwhelming for you in the beginning. Whenever you
feel it starts to make sense to you, MDN should be your stop for all the lookup on any HTML, CSS, JS concept/property.

### YouTube Channels
There are many channels but I can't personally vouch for any of them. For me, the above mentioned resources have worked greate.
However, You can check out Traversy Media, The Net Ninja, Web Dev Simplified, etc.

# Closing Notes
There are certain things that you need to understand, keep in mind and act upon them. This industry/field has its own
set of challenges and perks; Apart from them, you need to understand and become aware of yourself.

Stop looking for mentor/savior who can spoon feed you. Get started, get your feet wet. The best learning will come from
the problems that you run into and the solutions that implement; There's joy, achievement and confidence that you'll get
from this process.

In Self Learning, there's no one after you. You need to learn discipline, remain motivated, and learn accountability.
You're responsible for your actions and what you make of yourself. Take the ownership, lead and work on yourself for the
better. You'll need these qualities in your career too, so better you learn and practice them, rather than looking for
ways to have someone Police you!
